# SmartCar

## An event-driven car network platform to intellegently control your car.

### Example configurations:
+ Have your dashcam record video when your ignition is on, but only when you're going under the speed limit :)
+ At a certain speed, have your sound system play a different track.
+ Send a warning to your phone when your ignition has been on for 5 minutes but the car hasn't moved
+ When the key goes off, transfer your dashcam footage to a NFS mount in your house over Wifi

These are all possible configurations, but this isn't a "one-size fits all" solution. Some people might not have a GPS module, or an OBDII reader. They might not have a touchscreen, or a dashcam! How do we provide an intelligent car framework that can work with any configuration? This project aims to answer that question.

Each service is a container with a standard socket protocol (to be defined), so you can customize each piece for your car and what features you want to impliment or change.

This is a redesign on the original rpi-dashcam project, but uses a modular design with docker containers. I have open sourced this project since this surely has no market other than for extreme hobbists.

# Example Docker containers
+ Controller
  + The main container who's managing the entire application, managing the state of what's there and not
+ Dashcam
  + Records footage from the Dashcam when told by the controller
+ OBDII
  + Collects data from the OBDII port when told by the controller
+ GUI
  + Handles the GUI shown to the user by their touchscreen display
+ Voice
  + Processes microphone input from the car and passes information to the controller
+ Audio
  + Handles audio output, talking to the speaker system with the specific chip you bought for audio output
+ Backup Cam
  + Handles input from the backup cam, with the ability to take over the main display
+ NAS 
  + Sends data to a network attached storage device
  
# TCP based
I am currently designing a TCP JSON protocol to handle the inter-container communication. It is using redis with the rejson plugin to store JSON objects in memory with no persistence.

# Issues with Redis
+ Needed an external plugin to handle JSON objects
+ Relating events and actions requires intervalled scans to relate actions to be triggered by an event. In other words, to the controller, an event's action's container is unknown until that action is registered. Once that action is registered, it can search through the remaining containers to find what actions it provides, and fill in the container_id accordingly. However, if an action is registered before an event, it will not find the appropriate event actions to populate. There are two potential solutions to this problem:
  + Don't allow actions to be registered before all events are registered (an unlikely choice since it restricts the flexability of the system)
  + Have the controller keep a list of event-actions without relations and occasionally fill in the gaps (not ideal)
  + Use an RDBMS instead

# Issues with RDBMS
+ Tables are confusing
+ Relationships between options that could change in a heartbeat are too rigid
+ Hard to change the relationship if needs change

# What needs to happen
A redesign of the Redis JSON structure. I need more level 0 keys with values that circle back to "joined" level0 keys. This would give me the most flexability to "join" all the objects together, while providing a large "options" flexability. I am trying this method next. I also do not see any great RDBMS that does the job in memory like Redis does for key-value. I have no need for persistence in the state. If the computer shuts down, I don't care (unless I choose to save the state to disk for debugging later, which redis allows).
